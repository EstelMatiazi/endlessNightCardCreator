# endlessNightCardCreator
A simple app to generate prototype cards for the upcoming (tm) endless night CCG

To run, start a node server and access the index.html file with ´npx live-server´ on the src folder (or with whatever local development src tool you use). 
The index file contains a button that asks for a .csv file. A sample one has been provided in the /data/ folder. 
Once the file has been loaded, all of the placeholder cards will be generated and a button for generating a .zip with them as .pngs will also be available. 
You can edit the .csv file to generate only the cards that you need, or edit them individually to the desired values.
